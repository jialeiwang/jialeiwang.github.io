Lee partners with business leaders to develop novel transformational strategies in service delivery, quality, safety, operations efficiency, information management, change management and organizational learning. Leeâ€™s research focuses on mathematical programming; information technology; game theory; networks; machine learning for risk assessment, decision making, predictive analytics, and knowledge discovery; and systems and performance optimization. She has made major contributions and advances to business operations transformation, emergency response and medical preparedness (including biological and radiological/nuclear), medical care and procedures, and healthcare operations.  Specifically, her work has focused on multiple critical infrastructures, including power plant and energy, telecommunication, finance, healthcare, and supply-chain and logistics. 

Dr. Lee serves on the National Preparedness and Response Science Board; works with the White House National Security Council Directors of Medical and Biodefense Preparedness Policy on chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear strategies; and global health security agenda. She has served on multiple National Academies committees including evaluating BioWatch and National Biosurveillance Systems, medical countermeasures working groups, assessment and strategies for destroying the Blue Grass Chemical Agent-Destruction Pilot Plant, optimizing scheduling and access in healthcare, and  system approaches for health innovation. She is the principle investigator of an online interoperable information exchange and decision support system for mass dispensing, emergency response, and casualty mitigation. Lee has received prestigious analytics and practice excellence awards including the INFORMS Franz Edelman Award for Achievement in Operations Research and the Management Sciences; the Daniel H. Wagner Prize for Excellence in Operations Research Practice; and Pierskalla award for research excellence in health care management science. She is an INFORMS Fellow, and has received patents on innovative devices and medical systems.
