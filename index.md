While big data has been a topic of research and industry activity, much of it has been focused on unstructured data such as web logs, web crawl data, and social media data. One area which has received less attention but offers significant opportunities is that of **enterprise big data**. As companies drive towards leveraging analytics to create new value, they are faced with one of the most daunting challenges post the enterprise data warehousing era, **How can we link data from hundreds of business processes, tens of businesses, and combine relevant enterprise data with external data to enable novel analytical insights?** Consequently, Enterprise Big Data Semantics, Analytics and Modeling (EBDSAM) is an emerging area of research. It involves developing a new paradigm and technologies for handling of enterprise data. Much like **web data**, enterprise data also has volume, variety, velocity, and veracity challenges. This workshop will bring together academic researchers, technology company researchers, and industry practitioners from multiple industries, including Retail, Banking, Travel and Transportation, Government, etc. The goal of the workshop will be to share key challenges in EBDSAM, novel approaches to solutions, and new business challenges that can be addressed by big data semantic and analytics modeling. Participants are encouraged to start with specific business scenarios and demonstrate research prototypes they have created in the EBDSAM area.

Invited Talk: Semantic Search @ [NTENT](http://www.ntent.com/)
Semantic search lies in the cross roads of information retrieval and natural language processing and is the current frontier of search technology. The first part consist in building a semantically annotated index with the help of a knowledge base. For this we first need to predict the language of each document and parse it accordingly to that language. Second, we need to extract all entities and concepts mentioned in the document with the help of the knowledge base. All the knowledge base infrastructure needs to be independent of the language and we instantiate each language in the lexicon of the knowledge base.

The second part is predicting the intention behind the query, which implies doing semantic query understanding, using the same semantic processing of documents. After, based on all this information, we have to predict one or more possible intentions with a certain probability, which is particularly important for ambiguous queries. These scores will be one of the inputs for the final semantic ranking. For example, given the query ``bond'', possible results for query understanding are a financial instrument, the movie character, a chemical reaction, or a term for endearment. 

Semantic ranking refers to ranking search results using semantic information. In a standard search engine, a rank is computed by using signals or features coming from the search query, from the documents in the collection being searched and from the search context, such as the language and device being used. In our case we add semantic relations between the entities and concepts found in the query was the same objects in the documents, that will come from different data sources. For this we use machine learning in several stages. The first stage selects the data sources that we should use to answer the query. In the second stage, each data source generates a set of answers using ``learning to rank.'' The third and final stage ranks these data sources, selecting and ordering the intentions as well as the answers inside each intention (e.g., news) that will appear in the final composite answer. All these stages are language independent, but may use language dependent features.

Workshop papers can fall into any of the following categories involving exploiting of enterprise big data and / or enterprise applications:
* Natural Language Processing in business analytics
* Use of big data to estimate employee value
* Machine learning for financial planning
* Workforce optimization and skill mix strategy - use of big data to understand which teams or types of employees complement each other and work well together
* Internal company recommendation engines 
* Selection of products and offerings to maximize profit 
* Salesforce optimization
* Initiatives that use big data to understand and develop employee skillsets
* Use of big data to determine when/how to use various marketing and sales channels
* Challenges in organizing enterprise big data from a variety of internal sources
* Challenges of combining internal organization data with external data (for example, dealing with unique internal taxonomies)
* Additional related categories not covered above
