While big data has been a topic of research and industry activity, much of it has been focused on unstructured data such as web logs, web crawl data, and social media data. One area which has received less attention but offers significant opportunities is that of “enterprise big data”. As companies drive towards leveraging analytics to create new value, they are faced with one of the most daunting challenges post the enterprise data warehousing era, “How can we link data from hundreds of business processes, tens of businesses, and combine relevant enterprise data with external data to enable novel analytical insights?” Consequently, Enterprise Big Data Semantics, Analytics and Modeling (EBDSAM) is an emerging area of research. It involves developing a new paradigm and technologies for handling of enterprise data. Much like "web data", enterprise data also has volume, variety, velocity, and veracity challenges. This workshop will bring together academic researchers, technology company researchers, and industry practitioners from multiple industries, including Retail, Banking, Travel and Transportation, Government, etc. The goal of the workshop will be to share key challenges in EBDSAM, novel approaches to solutions, and new business challenges that can be addressed by big data semantic and analytics modeling. Participants are encouraged to start with specific business scenarios and demonstrate research prototypes they have created in the EBDSAM area.

Workshop papers can fall into any of the following categories involving exploiting of enterprise big data and/or enterprise applications:
* Natural Language Processing in business analytics
* Use of big data to estimate employee value
* Machine learning for financial planning
* Workforce optimization and skill mix strategy - use of big data to understand which teams or types of employees complement each other and work well together
* Internal company recommendation engines 
* Selection of products and offerings to maximize profit 
* Salesforce optimization
* Initiatives that use big data to understand and develop employee skillsets
* Use of big data to determine when/how to use various marketing and sales channels
* Challenges in organizing enterprise big data from a variety of internal sources
* Challenges of combining internal organization data with external data (for example, dealing with unique internal taxonomies)
* Additional related categories not covered above
